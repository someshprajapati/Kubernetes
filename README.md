# Learning Kubernetes and Deploy the App on Google Kubernetes Engine
#### Putting my Experimental Stuff here
   
## I am learning Kubernetes from scratch which includes the below:

1. Understand the purpose and theory of Kubernetes.
2. Build simple application on Kubernetes using already pushed custom images on docker hub.
3. Build a Kubernetes Cluster on the local machine Mac.
4. Build a Kubernetes Cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
5. Access the App using the Nginx-Ingress.
6. Integration of Github, Travis CI and GKE.
7. Automatically deploy the app via Travis CI on GKE when it is pushed to Github.

## Step by Step Sections:

1. Simple application on Kubernetes
2. Multi container app with Kubernetes
3. Multi container app deploy on Google Kubernetes Engine
